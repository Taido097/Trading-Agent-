**Last updated:** 2026-09-30 (10:16 ET — REAL TRADE OPEN: T-2026-0005 long 1 VALE @ 13.6472, stop 13.44, tgt 14.06 (2:1). First supportive+broadening tape in a week (SPY +0.53%, QQQ +0.69%; 3 affordable names broke ORs together); VALE = RS leader ORB break-and-hold on 2x vol. Regime gate that forced Fri/Mon/Tue passes is finally satisfied. Managing to breakeven on a favorable move; flatten by EOD, no overnight.)

## Operating Status

| Field                     | Value                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Development phase         | **MICRO-LIVE (real $20) + HIGH-VOLUME PAPER** (owner: "trade as much as possible to learn") |
| Trading mode              | Real $20: **MICRO-LIVE, setup-gated**. Learning volume: **PAPER** (sim $20k, many trades/day, real data, zero risk) via hourly engine |
| Paper engine              | Hourly 14:00–20:00Z (10am–4pm ET, 7 passes) weekdays; now STEP A real-$20 setup check (every pass, all day) + STEP B high-volume paper; logs to data/PAPER_TRADES.csv (kept separate from live) |
| Paper results             | 24 closed: 9 wins / 15 losers (net ~−$51 sim lifetime after 9/29's −$34.60). 9/29: RIVN coil-after-breakout-HOLD −0.87R (MFE +0.46R, MAE −0.91R nearly held, EOD flatten). Better-behaved than the prior RIVN spike-chase (P-18, −1R, MFE ~0) — entry location helped — but STILL a loss because SPY was soft/red. REINFORCED LESSON: entry-location is the edge, but REGIME is the ceiling; a good coil entry still loses when the tape won't cooperate. Real-$20 regime gate keeps proving out (RIVN passed real, then lost in paper). |
| Sizing basis              | Real equity (~$19.90) per RISK_RULES §9; $20,000 is a mental reference only, never sizes a live order |
| Live authorization        | **YES** — micro-live approved; equity order tools pre-approved |
| Options / crypto / margin | **NOT enabled** — options only after separate testing + explicit owner approval (owner: "later we can trade options") |
| Drawdown mode             | n/a (no capital deployed)                          |
| SAFE MODE                 | Inactive                                          |
| Robinhood connection      | **Connected — trade-enabled** (equity order tools pre-approved) |
| Tradable account          | "Agentic" ••••4713 (individual, limited_margin)   |
| `STOP LIVE TRADING` flag  | Not set                                           |
