**Last updated:** 2026-10-09 (Fri, ~11:13am ET / 15:13Z — intraday engine pass). Account **FLAT** ($19.54 cash, 0 positions, 0 orders). Regime GREEN day 3, firming (SPY 777.18 +0.42%, QQQ 749.69 +0.28%) — best of the 3-day relief bounce. REAL: PASS (2nd assessment today). SNAP's armed trigger (break-hold >6.16 on volume) DID fire — but at 14:35–14:40, *between* the 14:13 & 15:13 passes; it ran to HOD 6.29 (+6.2%) and is now extended, so entering at 6.225 = chasing (O002/entry-location). Re-armed SNAP for a FIRST-PULLBACK to the 6.16–6.20 shelf that holds (stop <6.05, 2:1 ~6.60). HL chopping 17.10–17.30, no clean hold → PASS, re-armed >17.30 break-hold or 17.10 pullback-hold. **Owner note (not self-applied): hourly cadence missed the clean SNAP real fill (mid-bar, between passes) — a real limitation; options = accept pass-time-only entries, or tighter cadence / resting buy-stop at the armed trigger.** Lifetime real UNCHANGED −$0.45 (2W/5L); capital preserved. PAPER open: P-0032 SNAP (+0.62R unrealized, MFE +1.0R to 6.29) + NEW P-0033 CCL coil-near-HOD (cruise theme). Quality-over-quantity (1 leader booked + 1 clean coil, not forcing marginal reps). Standing lesson intact: 3-day MFE>>realized under flat 2:1+EOD-flatten → midday partial/trail is a well-evidenced owner proposal (not self-applied). Options/crypto/margin OFF. Prior 10/8 EOD below. ⟶

## Operating Status

| Field                     | Value                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Development phase         | **MICRO-LIVE (real $20) + HIGH-VOLUME PAPER** (owner: "trade as much as possible to learn") |
| Trading mode              | Real $20: **MICRO-LIVE, setup-gated**. Learning volume: **PAPER** (sim $20k, many trades/day, real data, zero risk) via hourly engine |
| Paper engine              | Hourly 14:00–20:00Z (10am–4pm ET, 7 passes) weekdays; now STEP A real-$20 setup check (every pass, all day) + STEP B high-volume paper; logs to data/PAPER_TRADES.csv (kept separate from live) |
| Paper results             | 24 closed: 9 wins / 15 losers (net ~−$51 sim lifetime after 9/29's −$34.60). 9/29: RIVN coil-after-breakout-HOLD −0.87R (MFE +0.46R, MAE −0.91R nearly held, EOD flatten). Better-behaved than the prior RIVN spike-chase (P-18, −1R, MFE ~0) — entry location helped — but STILL a loss because SPY was soft/red. REINFORCED LESSON: entry-location is the edge, but REGIME is the ceiling; a good coil entry still loses when the tape won't cooperate. Real-$20 regime gate keeps proving out (RIVN passed real, then lost in paper). |
| Sizing basis              | Real equity (~$19.90) per RISK_RULES §9; $20,000 is a mental reference only, never sizes a live order |
| Live authorization        | **YES** — micro-live approved; equity order tools pre-approved |
| Options / crypto / margin | **NOT enabled** — options only after separate testing + explicit owner approval (owner: "later we can trade options") |
| Drawdown mode             | n/a (no capital deployed)                          |
| SAFE MODE                 | Inactive                                          |
| Robinhood connection      | **Connected — trade-enabled** (equity order tools pre-approved) |
| Tradable account          | "Agentic" ••••4713 (individual, limited_margin)   |
| `STOP LIVE TRADING` flag  | Not set                                           |

## Capital (Agentic account ••••4713, as of 2026-09-30 EOD)

| Open orders               | 0 (stop 6abd19c6 filled/consumed; no naked orders) |
| Status                    | **FLAT.** T-2026-0005 VALE stopped −$0.20 (−0.98R): breakout failed, MFE ~0 (bought breakout tick near HOD). Lifetime real P&L: F −0.11, AAL +0.05, CLF +0.05, VALE −0.20 = **−$0.21**. Real record: 2 wins (AAL/CLF coil+HOD-hold) / 2 losses (F no-edge, VALE breakout-chase). Lesson reinforced: reclaim/pullback entry > breakout-at-HOD, even on a green tape. |
