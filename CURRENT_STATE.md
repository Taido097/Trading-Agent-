**Last updated:** 2026-09-24 (16:00 ET EOD — flat & done. 3rd RED day. REAL: 0 trades (correct PASS), $20.00 preserved. PAPER: RIVN −1R (RS-in-downtape test #2, CHASED entry — lesson: entry location > the RS name itself).)

## Operating Status

| Field                     | Value                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Development phase         | **MICRO-LIVE (real $20) + HIGH-VOLUME PAPER** (owner: "trade as much as possible to learn") |
| Trading mode              | Real $20: **MICRO-LIVE, setup-gated**. Learning volume: **PAPER** (sim $20k, many trades/day, real data, zero risk) via hourly engine |
| Paper engine              | Hourly 14:00–20:00Z (10am–4pm ET, 7 passes) weekdays; now STEP A real-$20 setup check (every pass, all day) + STEP B high-volume paper; logs to data/PAPER_TRADES.csv (kept separate from live) |
| Paper results             | 18 closed: 7 wins / 11 losers, net ~−$17 sim lifetime. 9/24: RIVN −1R (RS-in-downtape test #2, CHASED the extension → MFE 0). A/B now clean: CLF coil +2R vs RIVN chase −1R → the edge is ENTRY LOCATION (coil, not chase), not merely the RS name. Regime gate stays: red tape → real PASS. |
| Sizing basis              | Real equity (~$19.90) per RISK_RULES §9; $20,000 is a mental reference only, never sizes a live order |
| Live authorization        | **YES** — micro-live approved; equity order tools pre-approved |
| Options / crypto / margin | **NOT enabled** — options only after separate testing + explicit owner approval (owner: "later we can trade options") |
| Drawdown mode             | n/a (no capital deployed)                          |
| SAFE MODE                 | Inactive                                          |
| Robinhood connection      | **Connected — trade-enabled** (equity order tools pre-approved) |
| Tradable account          | "Agentic" ••••4713 (individual, limited_margin)   |
| `STOP LIVE TRADING` flag  | Not set                                           |

## Reconciliation

| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Last reconciliation       | 2026-09-21 15:53 ET |
| Internal vs broker match? | **Yes** — flat, 0 positions, 0 open orders after AAL round-trip (buy 6ab176aa filled, stop 6ab176b9 cancelled, sell 6ab18b45 filled) |
| Discrepancies open        | 0                  |
| Today (9/21)              | 1 real trade closed (AAL +$0.05); GTC stop cancelled before the closing sell — no naked orders left |
| Notes                     | Account is limited_margin; per RISK_RULES we operate cash-only, no margin/leverage, until owner approves otherwise |
