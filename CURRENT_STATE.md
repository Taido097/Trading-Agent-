**Last updated:** 2026-10-09 (Fri, ~3:13pm ET / 19:13Z — intraday engine pass). Account **FLAT** ($19.54 cash, 0 positions, 0 orders). Regime GREEN, firming into the close (SPY 779.01 +0.66%, QQQ 751.45 +0.52%). REAL: PASS (6th/final intraday assessment). SNAP dead-flat 6.24–6.28 (6.26), 3pm O003 — CONFIRMED clean zero-real-trade day: supportive green tape all day but no affordable clean entry ever set up AT a pass; capital 100% preserved. Lifetime real UNCHANGED −$0.45 (2W/5L). **Owner note stands (not self-applied): hourly cadence missed SNAP's one clean mid-bar fill (10:35–10:40) — accept pass-time-only real entries, or tighter cadence / resting buy-stop at the armed trigger.** PAPER today: P-0033 CCL CLOSED −1.00R (coil resolved down; lesson: enter on confirmation not anticipation). OPEN into EOD: P-0034 PLTR +0.82R (broke out 206.44→207.85, tgt 208.55 0.70 away — the 'entered into resistance' worry resolved as trend reasserted); P-0032 SNAP +0.82R (dead-flat, digesting +7%, likely EOD-flatten short of 6.46 tgt). Next pass ~4:13 ET = EOD flatten both at official close + daily wrap. Standing lesson intact: MFE>>realized under flat 2:1+EOD-flatten → midday partial/trail is a well-evidenced owner proposal (not self-applied). Options/crypto/margin OFF. Prior 10/8 EOD below. ⟶

## Operating Status

| Field                     | Value                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Development phase         | **MICRO-LIVE (real $20) + HIGH-VOLUME PAPER** (owner: "trade as much as possible to learn") |
| Trading mode              | Real $20: **MICRO-LIVE, setup-gated**. Learning volume: **PAPER** (sim $20k, many trades/day, real data, zero risk) via hourly engine |
| Paper engine              | Hourly 14:00–20:00Z (10am–4pm ET, 7 passes) weekdays; now STEP A real-$20 setup check (every pass, all day) + STEP B high-volume paper; logs to data/PAPER_TRADES.csv (kept separate from live) |
| Paper results             | 24 closed: 9 wins / 15 losers (net ~−$51 sim lifetime after 9/29's −$34.60). 9/29: RIVN coil-after-breakout-HOLD −0.87R (MFE +0.46R, MAE −0.91R nearly held, EOD flatten). Better-behaved than the prior RIVN spike-chase (P-18, −1R, MFE ~0) — entry location helped — but STILL a loss because SPY was soft/red. REINFORCED LESSON: entry-location is the edge, but REGIME is the ceiling; a good coil entry still loses when the tape won't cooperate. Real-$20 regime gate keeps proving out (RIVN passed real, then lost in paper). |
| Sizing basis              | Real equity (~$19.90) per RISK_RULES §9; $20,000 is a mental reference only, never sizes a live order |
| Live authorization        | **YES** — micro-live approved; equity order tools pre-approved |
| Options / crypto / margin | **NOT enabled** — options only after separate testing + explicit owner approval (owner: "later we can trade options") |
| Drawdown mode             | n/a (no capital deployed)                          |
| SAFE MODE                 | Inactive                                          |
| Robinhood connection      | **Connected — trade-enabled** (equity order tools pre-approved) |
| Tradable account          | "Agentic" ••••4713 (individual, limited_margin)   |
| `STOP LIVE TRADING` flag  | Not set                                           |

## Capital (Agentic account ••••4713, as of 2026-09-30 EOD)

| Field                     | Value                     |

| Account total value       | $19.65 (all cash)         |
| Cash                      | $19.65                    |
| Open positions            | 0 (flat — VALE stopped out) |
| Open orders               | 0 (stop 6abd19c6 filled/consumed; no naked orders) |
| Status                    | **FLAT.** T-2026-0005 VALE stopped −$0.20 (−0.98R): breakout failed, MFE ~0 (bought breakout tick near HOD). Lifetime real P&L: F −0.11, AAL +0.05, CLF +0.05, VALE −0.20 = **−$0.21**. Real record: 2 wins (AAL/CLF coil+HOD-hold) / 2 losses (F no-edge, VALE breakout-chase). Lesson reinforced: reclaim/pullback entry > breakout-at-HOD, even on a green tape. |
