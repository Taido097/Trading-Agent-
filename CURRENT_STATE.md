**Last updated:** 2026-10-09 (Fri, EOD 4:13pm ET / 20:13Z — **DAY DONE, FLAT**, $19.54 cash, 0 positions, 0 orders, no overnight). GREEN relief-bounce day 3 held into the close (SPY 778.53 +0.59%, QQQ 751.24 +0.49%) — best sustained-green session of the week. REAL: 0 trades — PASS all day (CORRECT clean zero-real-trade day). SNAP's break-hold trigger DID fire (~10:35, >6.16, ran to 6.29) but filled BETWEEN hourly passes and was +6-7% extended by the time I could act; never offered a clean pullback-hold AT a pass. HL tagged 17.30 but failed to hold (metals fade) — the 'and-hold' rule saved the chase. Capital 100% preserved; lifetime real UNCHANGED −$0.45 (2W/5L). **Owner note (NOT self-applied): hourly cadence structurally misses clean mid-bar fills on fast movers (SNAP today) — accept pass-time-only real entries, or tighter cadence / resting buy-stop at the armed trigger w/ GTC stop pre-planned.** PAPER: 3 traded 2W/1L, net +1.68R (+$67 sim) — P-0034 PLTR +2.00R WIN (large-cap breakout-hold, FIRST full-2:1 target-reach in days), P-0032 SNAP +0.68R EOD-flatten (MFE +1.35R, stalled post-spike), P-0033 CCL −1.00R (coil-anticipation entry resolved down). LESSONS: enter on confirmation not anticipation (CCL); enter on the HOLD above cleared resistance not the tag (PLTR); MFE>>realized confirmed again but the one target-reach was the quality large-cap on the strongest tape — under-realization worst on cheap/choppy names (midday partial/trail stays a well-evidenced OWNER proposal, not self-applied). Options/crypto/margin OFF. Prior 10/8 EOD below. ⟶

## Operating Status

| Field                     | Value                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Development phase         | **MICRO-LIVE (real $20) + HIGH-VOLUME PAPER** (owner: "trade as much as possible to learn") |
| Trading mode              | Real $20: **MICRO-LIVE, setup-gated**. Learning volume: **PAPER** (sim $20k, many trades/day, real data, zero risk) via hourly engine |
| Paper engine              | Hourly 14:00–20:00Z (10am–4pm ET, 7 passes) weekdays; now STEP A real-$20 setup check (every pass, all day) + STEP B high-volume paper; logs to data/PAPER_TRADES.csv (kept separate from live) |
| Paper results             | 24 closed: 9 wins / 15 losers (net ~−$51 sim lifetime after 9/29's −$34.60). 9/29: RIVN coil-after-breakout-HOLD −0.87R (MFE +0.46R, MAE −0.91R nearly held, EOD flatten). Better-behaved than the prior RIVN spike-chase (P-18, −1R, MFE ~0) — entry location helped — but STILL a loss because SPY was soft/red. REINFORCED LESSON: entry-location is the edge, but REGIME is the ceiling; a good coil entry still loses when the tape won't cooperate. Real-$20 regime gate keeps proving out (RIVN passed real, then lost in paper). |
| Sizing basis              | Real equity (~$19.90) per RISK_RULES §9; $20,000 is a mental reference only, never sizes a live order |
| Live authorization        | **YES** — micro-live approved; equity order tools pre-approved |
| Options / crypto / margin | **NOT enabled** — options only after separate testing + explicit owner approval (owner: "later we can trade options") |
| Drawdown mode             | n/a (no capital deployed)                          |
| SAFE MODE                 | Inactive                                          |
| Robinhood connection      | **Connected — trade-enabled** (equity order tools pre-approved) |
| Tradable account          | "Agentic" ••••4713 (individual, limited_margin)   |
| `STOP LIVE TRADING` flag  | Not set                                           |

## Capital (Agentic account ••••4713, as of 2026-09-30 EOD)

| Field                     | Value                     |

| Cash                      | $19.65                    |
| Open positions            | 0 (flat — VALE stopped out) |
| Open orders               | 0 (stop 6abd19c6 filled/consumed; no naked orders) |
| Status                    | **FLAT.** T-2026-0005 VALE stopped −$0.20 (−0.98R): breakout failed, MFE ~0 (bought breakout tick near HOD). Lifetime real P&L: F −0.11, AAL +0.05, CLF +0.05, VALE −0.20 = **−$0.21**. Real record: 2 wins (AAL/CLF coil+HOD-hold) / 2 losses (F no-edge, VALE breakout-chase). Lesson reinforced: reclaim/pullback entry > breakout-at-HOD, even on a green tape. |
