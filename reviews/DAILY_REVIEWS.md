## 2026-09-16 (PRE-MARKET, 9:16 ET)
Mode: MICRO-LIVE ARMED (real ~$20). Strategy: Opening-Range Breakout (long).
Reconciliation: Agentic ••••4713 — total $20.01, cash $20.01, buying power $20.01,
  0 positions, 0 open orders. Internal journals empty -> matches broker OK.
Regime (pre-market): SPY 759.88 (+0.33% vs 757.39), QQQ 708.25 (+0.53% vs 704.54)
  -> mild risk-ON / positive open bias. Supportive for a long breakout, pending
  confirmation at the open.
Event risk: TO VERIFY at decision time — mid-September can coincide with an FOMC
  meeting; if today/tomorrow is FOMC, reduce/avoid per RISK_RULES §6. No known
  earnings for the watchlist names in this window (confirm at 9:47).
Watchlist screen (need 1 share <= ~$19, liquid, tight spread):
  - F     ~$13.51  spread ~$0.04  OK primary
  - VALE  ~$14.47  spread ~$0.04  OK
  - RIVN  ~$15.62  spread ~$0.05  OK
  - SOFI  ~$17.15  spread ~$0.05  OK
  - NIO   ~$3.60   spread ~$0.01  marginal (too low-priced; stop below risk band)
  - GRAB  ~$2.94   spread ~$0.01  marginal (too low-priced)
  - INTC  ~$100.68 dropped (exceeds $20 buying power; 1 share unaffordable)
Plan: at 9:47 ET, measure each candidate's first-15-min opening range; take the
  first valid long breakout that clears the full pre-trade gate; else PASS. No
  trade taken in this prep step.

## 2026-09-16 (DECISION, 9:48 ET) — PASS, no trade
Mode: MICRO-LIVE ARMED. Reconciliation re-checked: $20.01, 0 positions/orders — OK.
Regime: SPY +0.31%, QQQ +0.67% (green). But ALL candidates red and below their
  opening-range highs — relative weakness, the inverse of a long-breakout setup.
Opening ranges (9:30–9:45 ET) vs price at 9:48:
  - F    OR 13.440–13.565  now 13.48  -> inside range, no breakout
  - VALE OR 14.420–14.480  now 14.44  -> inside range, tiny (~$0.06), no breakout
  - RIVN OR 15.180–15.729  now 15.33  -> breaking DOWN on rising volume (bearish)
  - SOFI OR 16.810–17.160  now 16.94  -> below OR high, choppy/red
Decision: **PASS on all four.** No valid Opening-Range Breakout long existed.
  Devil's advocate confirmed: buying a red, underperforming name with no upside
  break is chasing/hoping, not an edge. Authorized != obligated.
Trades taken: 0 | Rejected: 4 (logged to data/REJECTED_TRADES.csv)
Realized P&L: $0.00 | R: 0 | Rule violations: none | Errors: none
Risk status: daily loss 0%, weekly DD 0%, consecutive losses 0. Capital intact.
Note: never verified whether today is FOMC; moot since we PASSed regardless.
