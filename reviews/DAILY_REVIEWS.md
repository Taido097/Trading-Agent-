## 2026-09-16 (PRE-MARKET, 9:16 ET)
Mode: MICRO-LIVE ARMED (real ~$20). Strategy: Opening-Range Breakout (long).
Reconciliation: Agentic ••••4713 — total $20.01, cash $20.01, buying power $20.01,
  0 positions, 0 open orders. Internal journals empty -> matches broker OK.
Regime (pre-market): SPY 759.88 (+0.33% vs 757.39), QQQ 708.25 (+0.53% vs 704.54)
  -> mild risk-ON / positive open bias. Supportive for a long breakout, pending
  confirmation at the open.
Event risk: TO VERIFY at decision time — mid-September can coincide with an FOMC
  meeting; if today/tomorrow is FOMC, reduce/avoid per RISK_RULES §6. No known
  earnings for the watchlist names in this window (confirm at 9:47).
Watchlist screen (need 1 share <= ~$19, liquid, tight spread):
  - F     ~$13.51  spread ~$0.04  OK primary
  - VALE  ~$14.47  spread ~$0.04  OK
  - RIVN  ~$15.62  spread ~$0.05  OK
  - SOFI  ~$17.15  spread ~$0.05  OK
  - NIO   ~$3.60   spread ~$0.01  marginal (too low-priced; stop below risk band)
  - GRAB  ~$2.94   spread ~$0.01  marginal (too low-priced)
  - INTC  ~$100.68 dropped (exceeds $20 buying power; 1 share unaffordable)
Plan: at 9:47 ET, measure each candidate's first-15-min opening range; take the
  first valid long breakout that clears the full pre-trade gate; else PASS. No
  trade taken in this prep step.

## 2026-09-16 (DECISION, 9:48 ET) — PASS, no trade
Mode: MICRO-LIVE ARMED. Reconciliation re-checked: $20.01, 0 positions/orders — OK.
Regime: SPY +0.31%, QQQ +0.67% (green). But ALL candidates red and below their
  opening-range highs — relative weakness, the inverse of a long-breakout setup.
Opening ranges (9:30–9:45 ET) vs price at 9:48:
  - F    OR 13.440–13.565  now 13.48  -> inside range, no breakout
  - VALE OR 14.420–14.480  now 14.44  -> inside range, tiny (~$0.06), no breakout
  - RIVN OR 15.180–15.729  now 15.33  -> breaking DOWN on rising volume (bearish)
  - SOFI OR 16.810–17.160  now 16.94  -> below OR high, choppy/red
Decision: **PASS on all four.** No valid Opening-Range Breakout long existed.
  Devil's advocate confirmed: buying a red, underperforming name with no upside
  break is chasing/hoping, not an edge. Authorized != obligated.
Trades taken: 0 | Rejected: 4 (logged to data/REJECTED_TRADES.csv)
Realized P&L: $0.00 | R: 0 | Rule violations: none | Errors: none
Risk status: daily loss 0%, weekly DD 0%, consecutive losses 0. Capital intact.
Note: never verified whether today is FOMC; moot since we PASSed regardless.

## 2026-09-17 (PRE-MARKET, 9:16 ET)
Mode: MICRO-LIVE PRACTICE on real $20, setup-gated (recurring routine).
Reconciliation: Agentic ••••4713 — $19.90 cash, 0 positions, 0 OPEN orders
  (yesterday's F buy+sell+cancelled-stop all closed). Matches internal -> OK.
Regime (pre-market): strong risk-ON gap up. SPY 763.6 (+1.3% vs 754.05 close),
  QQQ 716.5 (+1.7%). Supportive for a long breakout.
Event risk: TO VERIFY at decision — sharp gap suggests a catalyst; mid-Sept can
  be FOMC (decision ~2pm ET). ORB is a morning intraday trade so likely fine,
  but stay flat into any 2pm decision.
Watchlist (1 share <= ~$19, liquid, gapping with tape):
  - SOFI ~$17.28 (+2.6%) spread ~$0.04
  - RIVN ~$15.51 (+1.8%) spread ~$0.01
  - VALE ~$14.28 (+1.1%) spread ~$0.02
  - AAL  ~$13.06 (+2.8%) spread ~$0.01  (recovered from yesterday's fade)
  - F    ~$13.59 (+1.8%) spread ~$0.10 wide pre-market (should tighten at open)
Plan: at 9:47 ET, measure each opening range; take the first valid long breakout
  clearing the full gate; else PASS. No trade in this prep step.

## 2026-09-17 (DECISION, 9:48 ET) — WATCH, no entry yet
Flat confirmed ($19.90). Regime risk-on (SPY +0.94%).
Opening ranges (9:30–9:45) vs price at 9:48:
  - RIVN OR 15.47–15.93, now 15.78 (+3.6%) — strongest, volume surging, but
    consolidating BELOW the OR high; breakout NOT confirmed.
  - F    OR 13.59–13.80, now 13.785 (+3.3%) — at OR high but volume declining
    (weak breakout quality).
  - AAL/VALE/SOFI — below OR high / inside range / red. No.
Decision: WATCH RIVN (primary) + F. No entry — neither has broken and HELD above
  its OR high. Entering now = anticipating the break (the O001 mistake). Will
  re-check ~10:05 ET: enter only on a confirmed hold above OR high on volume,
  else PASS for the day.

## 2026-09-17 (RE-CHECK, 10:06 ET) — PASS for the day, no trade
Flat ($19.90). Regime still risk-on (SPY +0.85%).
  - RIVN: pushed to 15.875 but NEVER broke OR high 15.93, reversed to ~15.5,
    volume dried up; now 15.74 — failed breakout. PASS.
  - F: false break — wicked to 13.83 (above OR high 13.80) but closed back below
    and faded to 13.745 on weak volume. PASS.
Decision: PASS for the day. Neither confirmed a hold above its OR high; both
  faded. Correct outcome — we watched, the breakouts failed, no chase. Logged to
  REJECTED_TRADES. Trades taken: 0 | Rejected today: 6 | Realized P&L: $0.00.
  Discipline note: this is the ORB filter working — most opening-range pushes
  fail, and not-trading the failures is where the edge is preserved.

## 2026-09-17 (AFTERNOON, ~3:06 ET) — paper batch closed; real PASS
Owner asked to "trade the $20" ~1:50pm; I lined up CLF (RS +7%, at highs). A ~70min
tool/MCP outage delayed execution; on fresh data CLF had FADED off its base
(13.10->12.955) and it was ~54min to close. No clean setup → **real PASS** (would be
a no-edge late entry). Real account still flat $19.90.
Paper (high-volume learning): first batch of 4 RS-momentum longs closed —
  CHPT +2R WIN (+$79.64 sim); CLF -0.27R, MARA -0.56R, RIVN -0.12R.
  Net +$41.82 sim (+1.05R), 25% win rate — one 2R winner carried it.
Note: too late in the day to open a fresh paper batch responsibly; next paper
  passes resume tomorrow via the hourly engine.
